# Transfermarkt

Welcome to the Transfer-market! where you can find the value and a bunch of other details of your favorite soccer players. 

This gem provides the user the ability to look up a soccer player by their name, scroll the results, and select whomever he/she desires. Once the user selects the player, the gem will return a list of specific information relative to the player and ask them if they would like to search again. 

I hope you discover the values of all your favorite players! Enjoy!
